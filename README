Building CloudB OAuth
=====================


Building with Script
--------------------
It is possible to compile the sources using the 'build' script 
provided. In Windows systems, this accepts the optional argument
'mono', that targets the compilation to the Mono framework.

Building with NAnt
------------------
Alternatively to the use of the script provided, it is also possible
to compile CloudB by invoking directly NAnt and passing the main
script 'ouath.build' as argument.

Given '/home/deveel/cloudb' the base location where the package
was extracted, invoke the following:

Unix
mono /home/deveel/cloudb/libs/nant/NAnt.exe -buildfile:../../src/oauth.build

Windows
C:\deveel\cloudb\libs\nant\NAnt.exe -buildfile:..\..\src\oauth.build


'clean'   - Cleans up all the outputs of the compilation by any of
            the other targets

It is also possible to customize the compilation by specifying one
or more of the following variables.

'platform'  - Defines the target machine architecture of the compiled
              components ('anycpu', 'x86', 'x64')
'output'    - The path where the compiled components will be placed
'system'    - Indicates the operating system family targetted by the
              compilation ('windows', 'unix')
'libs'      - Points to the path where the external libraries required
              by the compilation are located
